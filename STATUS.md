## ‚úÖ Completed Features (Merged to Main)

### 1. Authentication & Auth Gating (PR #1)
**Commit:** dbfdb68
**Merged:** 2025-10-14
**Files Changed:** 12 files, +677 LOC

**What's Live:**
- Firebase Auth with Google OAuth (sign in/out)
- `useAuthReady()` hook prevents UI flicker during auth initialization
- `AuthGate.tsx` wraps entire app, shows sign-in screen when logged out
- `browserLocalPersistence` keeps users signed in across sessions
- Friendly üîí lock screen for unauthenticated users on protected pages

**Key Files:**
- `src/firebase.ts` - Firebase initialization with Google OAuth provider
- `src/AuthGate.tsx` - Top-level auth wrapper (148 LOC)
- `src/hooks/useAuthReady.ts` - Hook to prevent auth flicker (36 LOC)

**Firebase Collections Touched:** None (auth only)

---

### 2. Question Creator (PR #2)
**Commit:** 522e70f
**Merged:** 2025-10-14
**Files Changed:** 3 files, +490 LOC

**What's Live:**
- Full question creation form in "Ask" tab
- 4 question types: Single Choice, Rating Scale, Numeric Input, Date Picker
- Client-side validation: text required, options for single, min<max for numeric/rating
- Writes to `/questions` collection in Firestore
- Success/error feedback with auto-dismiss

**Key Files:**
- `src/questions/CreateQuestion.tsx` - Question form component (403 LOC)
- `src/db.ts` - `createQuestion()` helper function (87 LOC)
- `src/App.tsx` - Wired Ask tab to render CreateQuestion

**Firebase Collections:**
- `/questions` - Stores created poll questions
  - Fields: `text`, `type`, `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `options[]`, `min`, `max`
  - Security: Auth required to create (enforced by Firestore rules - see note below)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue:** Firestore rules currently deny all writes to `/questions` by default (line 8 of firestore.rules). Need to add explicit allow rule for authenticated question creation.

---

### 3. User Context & Onboarding (PR #3)
**Commit:** 8cb40fe (HEAD)
**Merged:** 2025-10-14
**Files Changed:** 6 files, +182 LOC

**What's Live:**
- Optional age/city context form in "You" tab
- `saveContext()` writes to private `/context/{uid}` collection
- `markOnboardingDone()` sets onboarding flag in `/users/{uid}/meta/onboarding`
- Firestore rules deployed: context data is private per-user

**Key Files:**
- `src/context/ContextForm.tsx` - Age/city form (not found in current tree - may be uncommitted)
- `src/db.ts` - `saveContext()` and `markOnboardingDone()` helpers (updated)
- `firestore.rules` - Security rules deployed to production

**Firebase Collections:**
- `/context/{uid}` - Private user context (age, city)
  - Security: User can only read/write their own data
- `/users/{uid}/meta/onboarding` - Onboarding completion marker
  - Security: User can only read/write their own metadata

## üß† Next Features (Planned)

### 1. Energy System Backend (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Branch:** feat/energy-backend (not created yet)
**Scope:** 150-200 LOC
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Requirements:**
- Create `/users/{uid}/energy` document with current balance
- Create `/users/{uid}/ledger` subcollection for transaction history
- Helper functions in `src/db.ts`:

  - `spendEnergy(uid, amount, reason)` - Deduct energy, log transaction
  - `earnEnergy(uid, amount, reason)` - Add energy, log transaction
  - `getEnergyLedger(uid, limit)` - Fetch recent transactions
- Update "You" tab to show live energy balance (replace hardcoded 0)
- Add Firestore rules for `/users/{uid}/energy` and ledger

**Firestore Schema:**
```
/users/{uid}/energy
  { balance: number, updatedAt: timestamp }

/users/{uid}/ledger/{txId}
  { amount: number, reason: string, timestamp: timestamp, balanceAfter: number }
```

**Success Criteria:**
